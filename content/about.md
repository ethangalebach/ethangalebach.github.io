Based in Oakland, California, I work as an actuarial analyst for the California Teachers' Association's (CTA's) auto and home insurer, California Casualty. 

Through my professional experience I have become proficient with visualization, modelling, and data pipelining libraries and tools using R, Python, and SQL. I also have been experimenting with dbt and Airflow in the hopes of adding them to our stack. 

When I am feeling technically curious outside of work, I like to play around with web app frameworks like Django, Flask, and Express, as well as languages like JavaScript, Rust, and Go.

In my free time, I like to do pottery, read history, stay civically engaged, play basketball, and explore new parts of the Bay Area.
