Work in Progress! In setting rates, pricing actuaries must forecast future frequency and severity levels. This is often done using simple and often inaccurate forecasting procedures such as the [*drift method*](https://otexts.com/fpp3/simple-methods.html#drift-method). Can [recent advances](https://paperswithcode.com/task/time-series-forecasting) in time series forecasting using deep learning be leveraged to improve actuarial loss trend selections?

To answer this question, I focus on the frequency of fatal accidents in the US. I derive my dataset from the Federal Highway Administration, NHTSA, BLS, and the Census Bureau.
